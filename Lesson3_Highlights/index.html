            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files so you can remember specific versions later on. A Version Control System (VCS) is valuable to use because it allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert entire projects to a previous state, compare changes over time, and see who last modified something that might be causing a problem. If a file is messed up or lost, it is usually simple to recover because of the VCS. There are local, centralized, and distributed version control systems that help keep file revisions under control.    </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Clone</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git Clone clones a repository into a new directory. This creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository, and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository's currently active branch. As a convenience, cloning automatically creates a remote connecton called origin pointing back to the original repository. This makes it easy to interact with a central repository. For example, if a project has been set up in a central repository, the git clone command is the most common way for users to obtain a development copy.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The working directory of a process is a directory of a heirarchial file system.The working directory has been called the current directory; The working and current directory are the same thing. When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative path, the reference is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the process. Most programming languages provide an interface to the file system functions of the operating system, including the ability to change the working directory of the program. If path names do not start with a root directory, it is assumed by the operating system to start from the working directory. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git. The first one is the working directory, which holds the actual files. The second one is the index, which acts as a staging area. Lastly, there is the index, which points to the last commit  made. To update the local repository to the newest commit, you must execute "git pull" in the working directory to fetch and merge remote changes. To merge another branch in an active branch, you must execute "git merge". Git may try to automatically merge changes, but conflicts could result. If conflicts occur, you must manually edit the files shown by git.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Push</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git push updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs. This means git push pushes commits made on a local branch to a remote repository. If a local copy of a repository is out of sync with the upstream repository a "non-fast-forward error will occur making you retrieve or "fetch" the upstream changes. Without additional parameters, git push sends all matching branches that have the same names as remote branches. If you and another developer try to push a commit at the same time on the same thing cloned, then Git will not allow someone overwriting the other. Instead it will run git log on the branch you are trying to push and make sure it can see the current tip of the server's branch in your push's history.  </p>
